## Data Usage

You can use the following code to preview the ProcessBench data:

```python
import json
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset('Qwen/ProcessBench', split='gsm8k')
print(json.dumps(dataset[0], indent=2))

# Expected output:
"""
{
  "id": "gsm8k-0",
  "generator": "Qwen2-7B-Instruct",
  "problem": "Sue lives in a fun neighborhood...",
  "steps": [
    "To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than...",
    ...
  ],
  "final_answer_correct": false,
  "label": 1
}
"""
